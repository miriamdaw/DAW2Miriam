UI/UX Designer 

* Tell me a little about yourself.
I am a 23-year-old Web Development student who is passionate 
about mixing technology with creativity. I studied Fine Arts 
at the Complutense University of Madrid, where I developed creative 
abilities that could be interesting for user interface design in web 
development. After that, I started a course in web application design, 
where I gained a foundation of technical and design skills necessary for 
creating engaging and user-friendly web experiences. My background in 
Fine Arts has given me a unique perspective on aesthetics and visual 
communication, which I believe distinguishes me in the field of UI/UX design.


* What are your strenghts?
With a background in Fine Arts, I have a strong eye for aesthetics and design, 
complemented by my skills in web development. I'm great at making interfaces that 
look good and are easy for users to use because I understand what users need.


* What are your weaknesses?
One weakness I've identified is my tendency to get overly focused on details, 
which can sometimes slow down my workflow. However, I've been working on improving 
my time management skills and learning to prioritize tasks.
Also, I've found that I can be too hard on myself, which can affect my confidence.
To fix this weakness, I seek feedback from peers and mentors for advice to feel better about my work.


* What are your short term goals?
My short-term goals are to improve my skills as a UI/UX designer and gain 
practical experience through projects. 


* What are your long term goals?
My long-term goals involve advancing in my career as a UI/UX designer, 
possibly taking on leadership roles and contributing to innovative projects. 
I aspire to be recognized for my creative solutions 
and user-centric designs. 


* Where do you see yourself five years from now?
In five years, I see myself fully independent from my parents, with a stable job 
in the UI/UX design field, and living with my partner, who also works in the IT sector. 
I envision advancing in my career, contributing to innovative projects in interface design. 
I see myself growing both personally and professionally.


* How do you organise and manage your time?
I'm starting to organize my time by making lists and prioritizing tasks. I use calendars 
and reminders to stay on schedule. Taking breaks helps me stay focused.


* Can you give an example of a time you went above and beyond in a work environment?
Certainly! During a class project, I went above and beyond by taking the initiative 
to research new solutions for a specific problem. I proposed an innovative idea 
that wasn't initially part of the task and successfully implemented it. 
This significantly improved the final outcome of the project and demonstrated 
my commitment to the team's success.


* Can you give an example of a time you failed, and what you learned form it?
Of course. Once, we missed deadlines due to miscommunication, partly because 
I struggled to prioritize important tasks. However, I learned from this mistake. 
While I wasn't the project leader, I realized the importance of clear communication 
and task delegation within the team. 


* Can you give an example of a time you had to deal with a difficult customer or coworker and how you handled the situation?
In a previous role, I dealt with a particularly unpleasant customer. Despite their demeanor, I remained composed, listened 
to their concerns, and offered solutions. By maintaining professionalism and focusing on resolving the issue, 
I managed to mitigate the situation effectively.
