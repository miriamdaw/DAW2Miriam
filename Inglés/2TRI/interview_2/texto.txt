I am a 23 year old web development student who is passionate 
about mixing technology with creativity. Also, 
I studied Fine Arts at the Complutense University of Madrid, 
where I developed creative abilities that could be interesting 
for a UX Designer for Games.


2
I've completed my degree in Fine Arts, 
and I'm currently finishing my course in Web Development. 
I can attach the documents to my resume if you need them.


3
During my year studying Web Development, I've learned 
various programming languages. For backend development, 
I've learned Java, Linux, and MySQL for databases, 
and I've also learned Git for version control 
and UML diagrams. On the frontend, I've learned PHP, JavaScript,
and HTML.


4
Since I'm still studying and finishing my degree in Web 
Development, I haven't gained any experience in the IT 
field yet. However, I'm looking forward to start my career in the 
field and grow professionally.


5
Why do you want to work in IT at this company?
I'm interested in working at Epic Games as a UX Designer for 
Games because I think my skills in web development, 
combined with my background in fine arts and passion 
for gaming, make me a great fit for the company.


6
I don't have any previous experience in IT or technical roles. 
However, I'm looking forward to learn in this field.


7
As we discussed before, I have skills in multiple programming
languages in Web Development. Additionally, I have
skills in digital design.


8
My strengths involve creative and technical skills. 
As I studied Fine Arts, I've developed a good eye for design, 
and I'm currently learning web development.


9
Sometimes, I can be too critical of my own work. 
To fix this issue, I ask for feedback from my 
teammates to improve my confidence in my work.


10
My short-term goals are to finish my course in Web Development
and keep growing professionally.


11
In five years, I see myself fully independent from my parents, with a stable job in the IT field, hopefully.


12
I organize my time by making lists and prioritizing tasks. I use calendars and reminders to not forget anything,
and taking breaks helps me stay focused.


13
Sure. During a web development project in my course this year, I applied my design skills to develop 
creative concepts for a website. I volunteered to create visual assets, including icons and graphics.
My initiative was appreciated by my team, and it made our project more visually appealing.


14
Certainly! During a team project, we missed deadlines due to misscommunication, partly
because at the time my time managing skills were not as strong as they are now. However, I learned from the 
situation and realized the importance of clear communication between teammates.


15
Of course. Two years ago, when I was working at McDonald's to save some money, I had to deal with an 
upset customer over a mistake in their order. I remained calm, apologized and offered to remake
their order correctly. I was able to resolve the problem and the customer left satisfied. 
This experience taught me that patience and kindness is important when you're dealing with customers.
