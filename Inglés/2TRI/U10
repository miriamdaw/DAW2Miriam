M: Hello Sergio! We have a business trip next week to Burgos. Do you want to plan the trip?

S: Hello! Okay, we should search into the internet what will be the weather next week in Burgos. Give me a second to write it in the search box. I'm going to write Burgos weather next week inside quotation marks.

M: Great.

S: I've found the results. Next week, the weather is going to be cold with moderate rain.

M: Okay, not bad.

S: How are we going to travel there?

M: I'm going to search it in a second. I searched Burgos trains timetable and it gave me a lot of results. What time is good for you?

S: I'd like to take the train at first time in the morning.

M: Okay, we have a train at 6:30 (six and a half), and we arrive at Burgos at 9:00 (nine o'clock ). Are you okay with that?

S: Yes. When the conference is over, we could hang out and do some fun activities. What do you think?

M: Sure! Let's search a tapas bar at the downtown of the city.

S: Ive writed in the search box Burgos +downtown +tapas +bar. Ive got many results. Bar FUXION Tapas y Copas caught my eye, and it's in Plaza Mayor. 

M: Great! Let's go there. Do we have something left to search for?

S: No, this time we do not have to worry for the exchange rate, because we are staying in Spain. See you next week!

M: See you!
